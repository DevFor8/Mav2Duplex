Fixes :
- Arduino 1.6.2. compatible
- GPS in EX format fixed (Thanks for cooperation!!)

Hardware 
- Arduino Pro Mini (or similar) with 5V / 16Mhz and ATMega 328
- 4.7k
- GND/RX connection to Mavlink capable board (Arducopter/MegaPirateNG) with OSD telemetry output allowed (same config as MinimOSD)
- servo connector for connection between Arduino and Jeti receiver (insert into telemetry socket)
- Duplex capable transmitter (old JetiBox, new Jeti transmitter or Jetibox Profi)

Troubleshooting 
- Arduino reseting
* measure your voltage for RC. If it is bellow or on 5V, connect to VCC instead of RAW pin on Arduino (!!WARNING , Higher than 5V voltage can smoke your Arduino)

- Speed update on data is slow
* version 1.0 have major improvement in this area, it should be ok

- Speed of EX telemetry is slow than text one
* this is by design of protocol. You can speed it up with commenting lines with     
* JB.addData(ITEMNAME_1,ITEMTYPE_1); and     JB.setValue(1,ITEMVAL_1); (with ID of data which you don't want)
* speed and ammount of data in text protocol will keep same
* We are not recommend to remove Home Dist parameter and have activated automatic record. This can help you with copter find in case of crash


- Future development
* Define base selection of items for Ex protocol
